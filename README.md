# Personal Blog
## What it is
This project was started because I wanted to start blogging about my programming journey. I used Foli's  "How to build a Blog(CRUD) with Angular 5, Firebase and Angular Material" on YouTube to build the app but added a couple personal customizations to the code base here and there.

## Things I Leared
- MVC Architecture in Angular

## Things I Want to Implement
- I would like to make the program work with just my account since it is a personal blog of my own journey
- Comments
